<dl><dd> Right, it doesn't make it technically wrong, just a little less grammatical (the subject of the sentence is "operators"). If you had made just this edit with the comment above, I would've ignored it, this wiki is full of awkward grammar, as it's a secondary concern. --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Cubbi.html" title="User talk:Cubbi">talk</a>) 10:29, 18 September 2015 (PDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></div>

<p>What was wrong with the existing sentences? What makes the new sentences better?
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>Not OK:</b> I wanted to be consistent, because if we want to be precise and write <i>id-expression</i> for the second operand of the member operators we must keep that precision for the pointer-to-member operators and write <i>cast-expression</i> for their second operand too (according to the standard). So we have to make a choice here: either we write <i>id-expression</i> for member operators and <i>cast-expression</i> for pointer-to-member operators, either we simply write <i>expression</i> for both, but not precise <i>id-expression</i> for the first and unprecise <i>expression</i> for the second as it was the case, or <i>vice versa</i>.

<dl><dd> This introduces an error. By saying that rhs is an "expression", you're saying that these operators may evaluate their right hand operands, but even <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">a.<span class="br0">(</span>b<span class="br0">)</span></span></span> or <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">p<span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span><span class="br0">(</span>b<span class="br0">)</span></span></span> are invalid. The acceptable choice is here is between the human-readable "name" and the standardese "id-expression". I would rather see it go back to "name", which is what it was before you started changing this page last month and I tried to appeal to the standard to stop the degradation. --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Cubbi.html" title="User talk:Cubbi">talk</a>) 10:29, 18 September 2015 (PDT)

<dl><dd> "cast-expression" is one of the BNF grammar productions that are, in human language, known as "operator precedence and associativity". You won't find it by that name in that table. Like all other expressions (other than the confusingly-named "id-expression"), cast-expressions can perform calculations, make function calls, print to screen, etc. "id-expression" is just a name of a variable, it can do no computation. --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Cubbi.html" title="User talk:Cubbi">talk</a>) 09:04, 19 September 2015 (PDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></div>

<dl><dd> It is used in the standard to highlight that it's not a data member of the instance object <code>E1</code> but of the naming class of <code>E1</code> since it's static.

<dl><dd> I don't know what "the naming class" means. This page doesn't have to explain core concepts that have their own pages; that's why "static data member" is a wikilink.
