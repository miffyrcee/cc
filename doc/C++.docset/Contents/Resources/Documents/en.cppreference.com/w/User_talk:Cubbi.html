<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Using-declaration_page">Using-declaration page</span></h2>
<p>Hi Cubbi,
</p><p>On this page: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="./cpp/language/using_declaration.html">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/using_declaration</a>
</p><p>I really liked this version: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/using_declaration&amp;oldid=137430">https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/using_declaration&amp;oldid=137430</a>
</p><p>And you removed nearly all of the comments and turned it back into this version, which is significantly different: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/using_declaration&amp;oldid=137498">https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/language/using_declaration&amp;oldid=137498</a>
</p><p>What comments do you think we can or should put back to make the important subtleties of the <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="kw1">using</span></span></span> usage more clear? 
</p><p>In the example code, <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="kw1">using</span> B<span class="sy4">::</span><span class="me2">f</span></span></span> is totally useless and does absolutely nothing since the override of that <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="kw1">virtual</span></span></span> function would happen without it, and <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="kw1">using</span> B<span class="sy4">::</span><span class="me2">h</span></span></span> is totally useless and does nothing because the function definition of <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="kw4">void</span> h<span class="br0">(</span><span class="kw4">int</span><span class="br0">)</span></span></span> then hides it, but (and this is <i>really</i> important) <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="kw1">using</span> B<span class="sy4">::</span><span class="me2">g</span></span></span> is absolutely necessary assuming the desired behavior is to keep <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="kw4">void</span> g<span class="br0">(</span><span class="kw4">char</span><span class="br0">)</span></span></span> exposed from the parent function instead of having <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="kw4">void</span> g<span class="br0">(</span><span class="kw4">int</span><span class="br0">)</span></span></span> from the child function hide it, thereby causing implicit casting to <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="kw4">int</span></span></span> if you pass a <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="kw4">char</span></span></span> to the child function. This is <i>really tricky</i> C++ behavior going on there that is begging for an explanation to even advanced users.

<dl><dd> Well, any feature in C++11 can be used, provided that the examples become simpler.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Lambda_.2F_Example"> Lambda / Example </span></h2>
<p>Hi! Good point on the std::function usage being already promised.
// <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="./cpp/language/lambda.html">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda</a>

</p><p>Clarification: shouldn't we at least say that there's a difference between these two cases?
Note that std::function in this case can introduce severe inefficiencies (regardless on whether it is common or not, this makes it a bad practice, IMHO).

<p>Wide character strings are not the same as multibyte character strings. There are actually three character string types:

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Re._mem.3D"> Re. mem= </span></h2>
<p>Hi. I've fixed the inconvenience caused by the necessity to use <code>mem</code> parameter in the <code>dcl list mem *</code> templates. Now if a <code>dcl list mem *</code> template is placed in a page which is not a sibling or parent of the target page the template links to, <i>member of std::</i> is added automatically. E.g.

<dl><dd> Cool, thanks. I wish i could understand that code you just changed! --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> 13:27, 19 January 2012 (PST)
<dl><dd> The idea is not very complicated, the syntax is. The <code>dcl list *</code> templates always get a path to function/class page they represent. When used, the template now checks whether the target page and the page they are used in have common ancestor. If yes, everything is as in the past. Otherwise, the template acquires and displays the name of the parent class of the target page. Here it knows that if we have <code>a/b/parent/member_function</code>, then there's always <code>Template:a/b/parent/title</code> and if the title template gets <code>#MAGICTITLESTRING#</code>, then it just yields in the part of the title which would be displayed in the smaller font. So for e.g. <span style="white-space:nowrap;"><code>{{cpp/container/vector/title|#MAGICTITLESTRING#}}</code></span> we get std::vector&lt;T,Allocator&gt; which is what we want. <a href="./User:P12.html" title="User:P12">P12</a> 16:50, 19 January 2012 (PST)

<p>Hey, thanks for all the work on the iterators.
I only wondered why you put the (int) overloads into the links for the ++ operators, for example
</p>
<table class="t-dsc-begin">

<tbody><tr class="t-dsc">
<td>  <div class="t-dsc-member-div"><div><a href="./cpp/iterator/reverse_iterator/operator%252B%252B.html" title="cpp/iterator/reverse iterator/operator++" class="mw-redirect"> <span class="t-lines"><span>operator++</span><span>operator++(int)</span><span>operator+=</span><span>operator+</span></span></a></div></div>
</td>
<td>   advances the iterator  <br> <span class="t-mark">(public member function of <code>std::reverse_iterator&lt;Iter&gt;</code>)</span>
</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<p>Usually the overloads are not specified in the links (e.g. constructors, operator[]).
</p><p>Would you be ok, if I started changing this to the shorter version below?
</p>
<table class="t-dsc-begin">

<tbody><tr class="t-dsc">
<td>  <div class="t-dsc-member-div"><div><a href="./cpp/iterator/reverse_iterator/operator%252B%252B.html" title="cpp/iterator/reverse iterator/operator++" class="mw-redirect"> <span class="t-lines"><span>operator++</span><span>operator+=</span><span>operator+</span></span></a></div></div>

<p>Could you please stop canceling all my work on this page? You can correct my edits, but please don't cancel everything without reading my improvements, especially when you bring back a version that is less consistent.
</p><p>1. You state that the subscript operator is not only for arrays. No problem, but then please be consistent and remove the word "array" in the summary table. Because the current situation is "array subscript" in the table, "Built-in subscript operator" in the title of the section and "Array subscript operator provides access to the elements in the internal array" in the explanation. What a mess for the reader!
</p><p>2. I corrected the prototypes of the summary table from this source: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operators_in_C_and_C%2B%2B#Member_and_pointer_operators">[2]</a> so please don't revert my edit or improve it from a better source. Plus I added missing semi-colons in the last prototypes of the tables and you reverted it, this is counter-productive.
</p><p>3. In the 1st paragraphs of the sections "Built-in member operators" and "Built-in pointer-to-member access operators", the description of the operands are not in the same order, that's why I changed it (1st—or left—operand THEN 2nd—or right—operand for BOTH sections) but you reverted my changes again. Please.
</p><p>4. In these same two sections, I used the same symbols "A" and "B" and you are persisting to keep "expr" and "member" in the 1st section and "E1" and "E2" in the 2nd section. I have nothing against these symbols, but again be consistent in your notations and use the same identifiers for the two sections (either textual identifiers or symbolic identifiers, but not both!)
</p><p>5. I insist: please be consistent!
</p><p>6. By the way: I appreciate your other corrections on the other pages that I edited.

</dd><dd>3 The loss of the link to id-expressions and of the note on evaluation of the left operand were the main triggers for the revert. I did restore your general wording later after bringing back that lost content.
</dd><dd>4 the right-hand operand of the member access expression is a very special beast, it is nothing at all like the operands of all over operators used on this page: the other operands are expressions that can perform arbitrary computations, but this operand is just the name of a member. I couldn't find a clear single-letter way to describe that differently from how the other expressions are described, so I used words. Perhaps a better approach would have been to use syntax parameter templates (<span class="t-spar">expression</span> <code><b>.</b></code> <span class="t-spar">member-id</span>), but that ended up unappealing too. The grammar still classifies the second operand as an expression (id-expression) and designates "E2" when described in the standard, so I restored your E2. --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 13:36, 26 August 2015 (PDT)

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Value_categories"> Value categories </span></h2>
<p>Hi Cubbi. My edit on the Value categories page was only about member access operators in order to make the statements match with the ones that are on the Member access operators page. I also uniformized the wording (the word "first operand" "second operand" was used everywhere in the page except in member access operators) and only changed the order of some item so that everything is symmetric for the 3 primary categories. Then I replaced the vague "some ternary conditional expressions" with the exact cases (it holds in a very short sentence so there is no need to remove the details) like for all the other operators. Finally I added a forgotten prvalue in the list: the one that is used for the pseudo destructor call. So except for this new prvalue I didn't really add or change anything apart for the style, it's just more consistent so easier to read. Should I split this edit in several small edits like they are in this step-by-step explanation?<br>

<dl><dd> It was a complex disruprive edit made to a sensitive page with no prior discussion. Changes to the conditional were wrong (it's "some" for a reason), changes to member access removed content. Granted with all these non-technical edits from last month, it's becoming increasingly hard to even understand what those sections is talking about, it should really go back to what it said before august. Pseudo-destructor is covered by the PMFC section and does not belong with regular rvalues. I don't agree with the reordering either, but it wasn't a technical error. --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 19:38, 19 September 2015 (PDT)

<dl><dd><dl><dd> Just to elaborate on the conditional part, since I'm the guy who introduced the "some ternary conditional expressions" wording: a correct (I think) description of when an conditional expression is an lvalue is
<ol><li> if one of the second and third operands is a (possibly parenthesized) throw expression, and the other one is an lvalue; or
</li><li> if the second and third operands are lvalues of the same type; or
</li><li> if the second and third operands are lvalues of the same type except for cv-qualification, and one is more cv-qualified than the other; or
</li><li> if the second and third operands have different types, at least one of which has a class type, and one of the second and third operands (call it <code>X</code>) is an lvalue of type <code>T</code>, and the other operand (call it <code>Y</code>) can be unambiguously converted to the type <code>T&amp;</code>, subject to the constraint that the reference must bind directly to an lvalue, and <code>Y</code> cannot be converted to match <code>X</code>.
</li></ol>
</dd><dd> And I even cheated a little above by not describing what "<code>Y</code> cannot be converted to match <code>X</code>" actually means. I think you can see why I went with the vague version instead. <p> While we are here, I'm not really a big fan of the current wording at <a href="./cpp/language/operator_other.html#Conditional_operator" title="cpp/language/operator other">cpp/language/operator_other#Conditional_operator</a>. The previous version was inaccurate in a number of ways, so I rewrote it by tracking [expr.cond] pretty much exactly, and the new version is probably correct, but it's also pretty dense and hard to understand. If anyone knows a way to simplify it without sacrificing correctness, I'm all ears. <a href="./User:T._Canens.html" title="User:T. Canens">T.

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> 1. Since the standard states, § 5.16. "Conditional operator", alinea 4, 5:
<dl><dd> "If the second and third operands are glvalues of the same value category and have the same type, the result is of that type and value category and it is a bit-field if the second or the third operand is a bit-field, or if both are bit-fields. Otherwise, the result is a prvalue."
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd> I thought it was a sum up for all cases (especially for the void cases listed in alineas 2 and 3), but apparently not (so I find the standard a little messy about the value categories here). So OK Cubbi an T. Canens, no problem for keeping the vague "some ternary conditional operator expressions".
</dd><dd> 2. OK Cubbi, if it does not really belong to "real" prvalues I will remove the special kind of prvalue I introduced.
</dd><dd> 3. OK Cubbi, for the moment I will keep the order as it was because it makes the edit very hard to read for everyone with the comparison tool, and we will come back to it later.
</dd><dd> 4. Not OK Cubbi about the "changes to member access removed content". I have only replaced the "every member access operators except" by "member access operators where" like it is in all the other items (consistency), but if you check with care I have not forgotten any case.

With the old wording of the page Value categories, there was no need to precise "using operator <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">.</span></span>" and "using operator <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">.<span class="sy2">*</span></span></span>" for listing the lvalue cases because they were listed negatively ("everything except…") and these exceptions do not depend on the first operand. But when listed positively (nothing except…) some lvalue cases depend on the first operand so it has to be explicitly said that this first operand is the one of the operators <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">.</span></span> and <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">.<span class="sy2">*</span></span></span> (after possible conversion from <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span></span></span> and <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span><span class="sy2">*</span></span></span>) and not of the operators <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span></span></span> and <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span><span class="sy2">*</span></span></span>. And by the way, the old wording (the current one actually, since you undid me) did have an error:
<dl><dd> "a built-in pointer-to-member access operator expression where the first operand is an lvalue and the second operand is a data member;"
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd> is a wrong statement since in the Member access operators page which has the same statement it is explicitly written that the operands that we are talking about are "In the expression <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1.<span class="sy2">*</span>E2</span></span>:" (so after possible conversion from <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">a<span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span><span class="sy2">*</span>b</span></span>). So actually my last edit did correct one error but didn't introduce new ones.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> Could you elaborate on this because I am not sure that I follow you here. To my understanding, since the standard explicitly states, § 5.2.5. "Class member access", alinea 2.:
<dl><dd> "The expression <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1<span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span>E2</span></span> is converted to the equivalent form <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="br0">(</span><span class="sy2">*</span><span class="br0">(</span>E1<span class="br0">)</span><span class="br0">)</span>.<span class="me1">E2</span></span></span>; the remainder of 5.2.5 will address only the first option (dot). Note that <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="br0">(</span><span class="sy2">*</span><span class="br0">(</span>E1<span class="br0">)</span><span class="br0">)</span></span></span> is an lvalue."
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd> that means that the second option (arrow) is addressed the same way, considering as the object expression <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="br0">(</span><span class="sy2">*</span><span class="br0">(</span>E1<span class="br0">)</span><span class="br0">)</span></span></span> instead of <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1</span></span>. So for instance the statement given in the standard for the first option (dot, that is <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1.<span class="me1">E2</span></span></span>), § 5.2.5. "Class member access", alinea 4.2.:
<dl><dd> "If <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1</span></span> is an lvalue, then <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1.<span class="me1">E2</span></span></span> is an lvalue; otherwise <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1.<span class="me1">E2</span></span></span> is an xvalue."
</dd></dl>
</dd><dd> would become for the second option (arrow, that is <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1<span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span>E2</span></span> = <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="br0">(</span><span class="sy2">*</span><span class="br0">(</span>E1<span class="br0">)</span><span class="br0">)</span>.<span class="me1">E2</span></span></span>):

</dd></dl>
</dd><dd> But according to you, the statement given for the first option would remain the same for the second option (arrow, that is <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1<span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span>E2</span></span> = <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="br0">(</span><span class="sy2">*</span><span class="br0">(</span>E1<span class="br0">)</span><span class="br0">)</span>.<span class="me1">E2</span></span></span>):

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> Alright. However I think you have not read my last answer correctly (or maybe I was not clear enough). I have never said that <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">a<span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span>b</span></span> cannot be a prvalue. The statement that I quoted from the standard was in the context of <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E2</span></span> being a non-static data member of non-reference type of course. So maybe I should reformulate my question better: <i>when <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E2</span></span> is a non-static data member of non reference-type</i>, what is the value category of <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1<span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span>E2</span></span>? The standard only address this case for <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1.<span class="me1">E2</span></span></span>, stating:
<dl><dd> "If <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1</span></span> is an lvalue, then <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1.<span class="me1">E2</span></span></span> is an lvalue; otherwise <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1.<span class="me1">E2</span></span></span> is an xvalue."

</dd><dd> So in other words, <b>what this sentence would become for <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1<span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span>E2</span></span>?</b>

</dd></dl>
</dd><dd> If it would become the latter, since <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp"><span class="br0">(</span><span class="sy2">*</span><span class="br0">(</span>E1<span class="br0">)</span><span class="br0">)</span></span></span> is always an lvalue anyway, then <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E1<span class="sy2">-</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span>E2</span></span> would always be an lvalue (<i>when <span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">E2</span></span> is a non-static data member of non-reference type</i>).

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="string_view_remove_prefix_example"> string_view remove_prefix example </span></h2>
<p>Hi, your example for string_view::remove_prefix has undefined behavior if find_first_not_of returns npos i.e. if the string is entirely blank (including if it is empty). The result will be to extend the start of the view backward one byte, which may not be visible if the previous byte is zero. I'm particularly worried that people might use this as the canonical way to left trim a string view. Do you think it would be worth it to protect the argument with std::max against v.size()? <a href="./User:Ecatmur.html" title="User:Ecatmur">ed@catmur.co.uk</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Ecatmur.html" title="User talk:Ecatmur">talk</a>) 12:32, 17 January 2016 (PST) PS.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Identifiers">Identifiers</span></h2>
<p>You say "an identifier is not an expression (id-expression is)" but you write in the article "The expression consisting of just the identifier returns" and "together with identifiers they are known as <i>id-expressions</i>" and the standard explicitly states the following categories:
</p>
<ul><li> id-expression
<ul><li> unqualified-id
<ul><li> <b>identifier</b>
</li><li> operator-function-id
</li><li> conversion-function-id
</li><li> literal-operator-id
</li><li> ~ class-name
</li><li> ~ decltype-specifier
</li><li> template-id
</li></ul>
</li><li> qualified-id
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>An identifier is an unqualified-id, which is an id-expression, which is an expression, so an identifier <i>is</i> an expression.
</p><p>And the current version of the article is a mess:
</p>
<ul><li> inconsistent naming: (operator function, operator in function notation), (template identifier, template-id);
</li><li> inconsistent examples and styles: (<span class="t-c"><span class="mw-geshi cpp source-cpp">MyTemplate<span class="sy1">&lt;</span><span class="kw4">int</span><span class="sy1">&gt;</span></span></span>, <code>name&lt;arg, arg&gt;</code>);
</li><li> ambiguous sentences: "Besides simple names of objects and functions, the following language constructs can be used in expressions in the same role (together with identifiers they are known as <i>id-expressions</i>)".
</li></ul>
<p>"that is not a complete list by far": alright on this point.

<dl><dd> the grammar does not tell you what something is, it has nothing to do with semantics. It says that any sequence of digits and non-digits beginning with a non-digit is accepted by the parser where the grammar production <i>expression</i> is expected.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> for "inconsistent naming: (operator function, operator in function notation),", yes, it is an inconsistency. If you think it's worth correcting that, make an edit that does so with the summary "renamed "operator function" to "operator in function notation" for consistency with the section on names" instead of rewriting the entire page in completely new terms with "wording" as a summary.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> Regarding "template id" and "template identifier", template-id is bad because it's a BNF term  and "template identifier" is bad because it's incorrect (it's not an identifier).

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Type_Traits"> Type Traits </span></h2>
<p>Hi, it looks like you wrote most of the type traits docs. Most of the pages I looked at have the text "provides the member constant value equal true. For any other type, value is false." That isn't correct English, specifically "value equal true" is not grammatically correct. One alternative would be "provides the member constant value, equal to true" instead.
</p><p>Also, the way the sentence is phrased is somewhat ambiguous. One possible reading is that if the condition is true, it provides the member 'value'. But (for most traits) the member is always provided, not only when the condition is true. One option would be to separate the part about providing the member, so that it isn't implied to be conditional on the property being tested.
</p><p>The 'is_union' page avoids both these problems (although the punctuation was slightly incorrect there, so I've just fixed that). <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=User:Jwakely&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jwakely (page does not exist)">Jwakely</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Jwakely.html" title="User talk:Jwakely">talk</a>) 10:27, 15 April 2016 (PDT)

<dl><dd>I don't think we can individually tag dcl components while we are using GeSHi to do syntax highlighting, but then we probably don't actually need the full syntax highlighting powers in dcls.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="std::visit_example"> std::visit example </span></h2>
<p>I see you've removed the simpler std::visit example. The current visit example is insane for such a simple concept and takes an elitist approach to examples. The concepts you need to know to quickly understand std::visit's example&nbsp;: general template meta programming, std::false_type, variadic templates, custom type traits, std::decay, decltype, c++ type_traits, if constexpr. I'm not even sure I fully understand the "overloaded" example.
</p><p>In the hopes of making simple things simple, the example should demonstrate how to use std::visit. Not write nifty template metaprogramming to show off how crazy you can get with c++&nbsp;;) That should be reserved for blogs IMHO.
</p><p>My 2 cents, good day.
</p>
<dl><dd> the first thing the existing std::visit example shows is the example you suggested, only in a slightly simpler form. --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 18:41, 15 September 2018 (PDT)

<dl><dd> as noted in the comment, that introduced implementation details into a lead intro that tries to be as simple as possible, and they were not totally correct (it's not "all variables", it's autos and temporaries whose lifetime crosses the suspension point, much like how lambdas don't capture everything in scope, only what's used.. and they are not necessarily on heap - the designers fought hard against making heap allocations unless required).  Sure, the effect is as-if it captured everything on-heap, but that only reinforces the perception of inefficiency that delayed the coroutines so much. --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 08:30, 13 August 2019 (PDT)
